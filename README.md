# AmusementParkPassGenerator-Part2
Treehouse iOS Techdegree Project #5

You will now take the code you created in Project 4 (Amusement Park Generator: Part 1) and add User Interface, along with a short list of new features and entrant types. These changes may force you to refactor some code in order to accommodate them.

Upon completion, you will have an app, created entirely yourself, which can take user input, create personalized entrant passes for a variety of entrant types as well as test their “swipe-ability” at various locations.

Create a new Xcode project and make sure it is configured to a public github repository.

Construct an iPad user-interface as per the attached screenshots. Your app should look as close as possible to the screenshots, though some variation is acceptable. You are free to to add your own design elements (images, fonts, colors) as long as the layout remains consistent with the mockups provided.

Utilize the code created in Project 4 to add functionality to user-interface. You may need to refactor, tweak or rewrite some of the code from Project 4 in order to complete all of the requirements for this project.

Make sure your app can perform all of the following tasks:

Create entry passes for the seven entrant types listed in Project 4 (Classic, VIP, Free Child, Hourly Employee - Food, Hourly Employee Maintenance, Manager)

Create entry passes for the four additional entrant types listed in Project 5 (Season Pass Guest, Senior Guest, Contract Employee, Vendor)

Ensure that all necessary information is present before issuing a particular type of pass - if not, display appropriate message

•Test the pass for entry to various areas (Amusement, Ride, Kitchen, Maintenance, Office)

•Test the pass for ride access

•Test the pass for line skipping

•Test the pass for discounts on food and merchandise

•Still satisfy all code requirements from Project 4

NOTE: To get an "exceeds" rating, you should implement the following input validation feature, marked as “extra credit” in the rubric, and/or earn "exceeds" ratings for at least two of the other requirements where an “exceeds” rating is shown (App Layout, Enumerations,"Swipe" methods, Plug Values).

Add additional text validation to ensure that phone numbers and zip codes are all numerical and that all text entries are of “reasonable” length. You can decide what you deem reasonable, simply describe in a code comment. You will only be graded on the implementation.
